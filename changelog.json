        "1.5-11": " - Updated to Minecraft 1.11.2\n - Added Panel Meters to monitor a redstone signal with reasonable accuracy\n - Multiple components on the same panel network can modify the same signal now without causing undefined behavior\n - Lock Switches no longer break the model cache",
        "1.5-12": " - Added tilted control panels\n   - Panels are no longer created from machine casings, there is a dedicated item for that now, the Unfinished Control Panel\n   - Angle and height can be configured in the Engineer's Workbench\n - Fixed a CME when multi-threaded chunk rendering is enabled\n - Fixed control panels not connecting or disconnecting properly when a panel connector between the panel and the RS controller is broken/placed\n - Improved the performance of the control panel hitbox rendering",

    "1.12.2": {
        "1.5-14": " - Updated to Minecraft 1.12\n - Added a recipe for the key ring. Kind of forgot about adding one when I added the ring itself...\n - Fixed wire length crafting leaving wrong coils when the output has maximum length\n - Fixed some more connection issues with control panels",

        "1.6-20": " - Added the Marx Generator, an alternative ore processing method\n   - Hearing protection absolutely required!\n   - You may need to do some math and measurements for ore processing to work. It will kill entites just fine without any science\n - IC2 is no longer a hard dependency. The wires and converters will obviously be disabled without it\n - Vastly improved snapping in the panel creator\n - Added some Mirage (Albedo) compat\n - IW is signed now!\n - Analog panel components can interact with 2 channels now, rough and fine control\n - Fixed GUI background and item tooltips\n - Fixed some components resetting when the chunk is unloaded\n - Chunks with control panels properly unload now",
        "1.6-21": " - Added shaders for the Marx generator and Jacob's ladder\n - Fixed wires connected to a Marx generator on a server being invisible\n - The Marx generator actually gives output when processing ores now. Oops...\n - The \"safe distance\" formulas for the Marx generator in the manual now match the real safe distance\n - Improved rendering of the Marx generator in the manual. Some of this is only enabled with maven build 275+ or official build 75+ (not released yet)",
        "1.6-22": " - Added a Seven-Segment display for control panels\n - Panel components update their values as soon as they are changed in the GUI\n - Fixed a crash when breaking a panel with buttons, locks or toggle switches on it under special circumstances\n - Fixed server crashes when using panel components with a second controller id, but no channel set\n - Fixed various NPE crashes with control panel models under heavy load\n - Fixed wrong panel component ordering with raytracing",

        "1.6-25": " - Updated to IE build 77\n   - IC2 wires cause damage\n   - Added insulated versions of gold, copper and tin wires. Due to heat sensitive insulation the transfer capacity is half of the normal capacity\n   - Added feedthrough insulators for all IC2 wire types\n - Wire coils now automatically \"merge\" when picked up\n - Config values are applied to the game directly now",
        "1.7-26": " - Added Mechanical Multiblocks (energy storage and EU<->FE conversion)\n   - There will be an explanation video for these once I have time to make one\n - Fixed the small mechanical converter blowing up tin wires\n - Fixed wires not joining their outputs correctly\n - Fixed wire connectors not breaking when the block they're on is broken",
